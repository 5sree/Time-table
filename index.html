   <!--<center><h1>Maheshbabu</h1></center>
    <center><p1>Mahesh Babu (born 9 August 1975) is an Indian actor, producer, media personality, and philanthropist who works in Telugu cinema. He is one of the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema. He first appeared in the 1979 film Needa when he was four years old.[1] He continued to perform as a child actor in several films, most of which featured his father Krishna.[2] Following his role as the titular protagonist in Balachandrudu (1990) while still a child, his career went on hiatus so he could concentrate on his education until taking on his first lead role as an adult in the 1999 film Rajakumarudu, for which he won the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[3][4] Afterwards, his career stagnated until successes like Murari (2001), Okkadu (2003) and Athadu (2005) brought him fame.[2][5] In 2006, he played a gangster in the Puri Jagannadh-directed action-thriller Pokiri. The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time,[6][7] and according to Vogue India, cemented Babu's reputation as a "superstar".</p1></center>
